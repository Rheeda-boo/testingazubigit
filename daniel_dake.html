            <h3>A Message From The CEO</h3>
        </p>
        <p>The C.E.O in an interview was asked for his motivation in bringing up this restaurant. This<br> is what he said:
            <blockquote> <q>There is no food difficult for you to eat. It is just a matter of psyching yourself.</br> 
                Free your mind and the food will settle in your
            belly because the sweetness of<br>the pudding is in the eating.</q>
                <p> <cite>-Honourable Nana Yaw Oduro</cite></p>
