<h2>A Message From The C.E.O</h2>
<p>The C.E.O, in an interview was asked for his motivation in bringing up this restaurant. This<br>
is what he said:
<blockquote>
<q>There is no food difficult for you to eat. It is just a matter of you psyching yourself.<br>
Free your mind and the food will settle in your belly because the sweetness of <br>
the pudding is in the eating.</q><br>
&mdash;<cite>Honourable Nana Yaw Oduro</cite>
