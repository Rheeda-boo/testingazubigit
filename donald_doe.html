<h2>A Message From The C.E.O</h2>
<p>The C.E.O, in an interview was asked for his motivation in bringing up this restaurant. This is what he said:<br>
	<blockquote>"There is no food difficult for you to eat. It is just a matter of psyching yourself.<br> Free your mind and the food will settle in your belly because the sweetness of the pudding is in the eating".<br></br>
